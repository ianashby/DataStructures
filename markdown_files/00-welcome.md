# Python Data Structures Final Project

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Final Project! This project is designed to help you learn about various Python data structures:

* [Queues](/markdown_files/01-queues.md)
* [Sets](/markdown_files/02-sets.md)
* [Trees](/markdown_files/03-trees.md)

Each of the data structures is described in detail in the corresponding markdown file. Each of the files contains a brief description of the data structure, along with instructions on how to use it. Finally, the files contain a sample implementation of the data structure and a final coding exercise for you to complete.
